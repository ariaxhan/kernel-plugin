# Initialize KERNEL

Create project-specific Claude Code configuration by analyzing the codebase and tailoring every artifact to this project's actual needs.

**Philosophy**: KERNEL uses banks as methodology guides, not as copy-paste templates. Methodology is applied automatically based on context - no commands needed.

**For comprehensive analysis with _memory/ generation, hotspot detection, and GitHub Actions setup, use `/repo-init` instead.** This command provides a lighter-weight initialization focused on `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and essential project config.

---

## Step 1: Analyze the Project

Gather context before creating anything:

```
READ:
- README.md → purpose, features, audience
- package.json / pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / go.mod → stack, dependencies
- Existing tests → testing patterns, coverage expectations
- .github/workflows → CI patterns (if any)
- Existing .claude/ → prior configuration
- Source structure → module organization, key files
```

**Determine:**
- **Tier**: 1 (hackathon), 2 (production), 3 (critical systems)
- **Stack**: Primary language, frameworks, tools
- **Domain**: API, CLI, library, web app, mobile, etc.
- **Patterns**: How errors are handled, how tests are structured, naming conventions

---

## Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions (If Needed)

If intent is unclear, ask:
- "What's the primary use case for this project?"
- "Are there any specific workflows you repeat often?"
- "What quality standards matter most? (tests, types, docs)"

Don't assume - ask when uncertain.

---

## Step 3: Create Directory Structure

Only create what's needed:

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md       # Project intelligence (always)
├── commands/       # Only if project has repeatable workflows
├── rules/          # Only if project has specific conventions
└── settings.json   # Only if hooks make sense for this stack
```

**Do NOT create empty directories.** If no commands are needed, don't create `commands/`.

---

## Step 4: Write Project CLAUDE.md

Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with content tailored to THIS project:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

**[One-line description of what this project does]**

---

## Project Context

**Tier**: [1/2/3] - [explanation]
**Stack**: [detected stack]
**Domain**: [what kind of project]

**Key constraints**:
- [Constraint 1 specific to this project]
- [Constraint 2 specific to this project]

---

## Coding Rules

[Rules that emerged from analyzing THIS codebase, not generic best practices]

### [Category 1]
- [Specific rule observed in codebase]
- [Another specific rule]

### [Category 2]
- [More specific rules]

---

## Default Behaviors

These behaviors apply automatically based on task context:

### When Implementing New Features
1. Research existing solutions before writing custom code
2. Plan the approach and define interfaces first
3. Mentally simulate execution before coding
4. Review against requirements before completing

### When Debugging
1. Reproduce the issue with exact steps
2. Isolate to smallest failing case
3. Instrument to understand actual behavior
4. Fix root cause, not symptoms

### When Refactoring
1. Understand current implementation deeply first
2. Identify specific improvements (not vague refactoring)
3. Make one change at a time, verify each
4. Less code is usually better code

### Before Completing Any Task
1. Review against original requirements
2. Check convention adherence
3. Validate edge cases handled
4. Confirm no regressions

Methodology banks in `kernel/banks/` provide deeper guidance when needed.

## Commands

[Only list project-specific commands that were created]

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/command-name` | Why this command exists for this project |

---

## KERNEL Reference

**Banks** (auto-applied based on context):
- `PLANNING-BANK.md` — Interface-first design, mental simulation
- `DEBUGGING-BANK.md` — Reproduce → Isolate → Root cause → Fix
- `RESEARCH-BANK.md` — Find existing solutions before custom code
- `REVIEW-BANK.md` — Correctness, consistency, completeness
- `DISCOVERY-BANK.md` — Map unfamiliar codebases
- `ITERATION-BANK.md` — Systematic improvement
- `TEARITAPART-BANK.md` — Critical review before implementation

**Explicit commands** (when you need them):
- `/build` — Full pipeline from idea to working code
- `/docs` — Documentation mode
- `/branch`, `/ship`, `/release` — Git workflow
- `/handoff` — Session continuation
```

---

## Step 5: Create Commands (Only If Needed)

**Before creating any command, ask**: "Would this project actually use this?"

**Good reasons to create a command:**
- Workflow is repeated 2+ times in this project
- Project has a specific multi-step process (deploy, release, test cycle)
- Team has requested automation for something

**Bad reasons to create a command:**
- "It might be useful someday"
- "Other projects have this"
- "The template includes it"

**When creating a command:**
- Write it specifically for this project's tools and structure
- Reference actual file paths and commands
- Include project-specific context

---

## Step 6: Create Rules (Only If Needed)

Rules capture preferences and patterns specific to this project.

**Only create rules for:**
- Explicitly stated preferences ("we use tabs", "no semicolons")
- Observed patterns that differ from defaults
- Non-negotiable constraints (security, compliance)

**Do NOT create rules for:**
- General best practices (those are assumed)
- Things that haven't been decided yet
- Preferences that can be inferred from tooling config

---

## Step 7: Configure Hooks (Only If Stack Benefits)

Hooks run automatically on tool use. Only configure if:
- Project has formatters/linters that should auto-run
- Project has validation that should happen on writes
- Stack has common automation patterns

**Example decision tree:**
- Python project with Black/Ruff → configure PostToolUse formatter hook
- Rust project with cargo fmt → configure PostToolUse formatter hook
- Markdown-only project → probably no hooks needed
- Project without tests → don't add test-running hooks

---

## Step 8: Report What Was Created

```
KERNEL initialized for [Project Name]

Detected:
  Tier: [tier] — [why]
  Stack: [stack]
  Domain: [domain]

Created:
  .claude/CLAUDE.md     — Project intelligence + default behaviors
  [.claude/commands/]   — [N commands, if any]
  [.claude/rules/]      — [N rules, if any]
  [.claude/settings.json] — [Hooks, if any]

Not created (not needed for this project):
  [List anything intentionally skipped and why]

Automatic methodology:
  Planning, debugging, research, review behaviors are applied
  automatically based on task context. No commands needed.

Explicit commands available:
  /build    — Full implementation pipeline
  /docs     — Documentation mode
  /branch   — Create worktree
  /ship     — Push and create PR
  /release  — Tag and publish
  /handoff  — Session continuation

Next steps:
  1. Review .claude/CLAUDE.md and adjust if needed
  2. Start working - methodology applies automatically
  3. Patterns will emerge as you work
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **DON'T copy-paste bank content** into CLAUDE.md - reference banks, don't duplicate
- **DON'T create generic commands** - every command should mention this project's specifics
- **DON'T assume conventions** - discover them from the codebase
- **DON'T create empty structures** - if nothing goes in a directory, don't create it
- **DON'T include irrelevant methodology** - no frontend rules for a CLI tool

---

## What Makes Good Project Config

**Specific**: References actual files, paths, and tools in this project
**Minimal**: Only includes what's actually used
**Grounded**: Rules based on observed patterns, not aspirations
**Honest**: Describes reality, admits what's not yet decided

See `kernel/CLAUDE.md` for the distributable template, and the plugin root `CLAUDE.md` for the full methodology reference.

**Need deeper analysis?** Use `/repo-init` for comprehensive codebase analysis with _memory/ population, hotspot detection, dependency mapping, and optional GitHub Actions setup.
