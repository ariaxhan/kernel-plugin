# KERNEL

**The AI Coding OS for Claude Code** | v4.0.0

KERNEL is a Claude Code plugin that transforms how you develop. It analyzes your codebase, creates tailored configuration, spawns specialized agents, applies methodology automatically, and evolves over time. Your coding assistant becomes a coding OS.

---

## What's New in v4.0.0

- **Compact Unicode syntax** — Token-efficient configuration using symbolic markers (Ψ, →, ≠, Σ, Φ, Ω, Ξ, Δ, ∇, Γ)
- **5-tier model routing** — Ollama → Gemini → Sonnet → Opus → Haiku with purpose-driven selection
- **Hooks system** — Auto-detect project type on session start, auto-validate after code edits
- **Magic keywords** — `ulw` (ultrawork), `ralph` (persistence), `eco` (cost-optimized)
- **Autonomy rules** — ACT/PAUSE/ASK boundaries for safe autonomous operation
- **16 commands** — Added `/design` (UI philosophy) and `/repo-init` (generate config for any project)
- **13 rules** — Added `frontend-conventions` for design-intentional UI development
- **coding-prompt-bank skill** — Base AI coding philosophy with tier-based complexity
- **Memory system** — `_memory/` templates for persistent project knowledge
- **Frontend design philosophy** — Anti-AI-aesthetic enforcement, signature element approach

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin

```
/install-plugin https://github.com/ariaxhan/kernel-claude
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

```bash
cd your-project
claude

# Inside Claude Code:
/kernel-init
```

KERNEL analyzes your project and creates:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Project-specific coding rules
- `.claude/rules/` — Patterns discovered in your codebase
- `_meta/` — Session tracking structure
- `_memory/` — Project knowledge base

### 3. Work Normally

Methodology applies automatically:
- **Implementing a feature?** KERNEL researches and plans first
- **Fixing a bug?** KERNEL debugs systematically (reproduce → isolate → root cause)
- **Writing code?** KERNEL spawns test-runner and type-checker
- **Before completing?** KERNEL reviews for correctness

No commands to remember. Just work.

---

## Understanding the Syntax

KERNEL uses a compact, token-efficient syntax in its `CLAUDE.md`. Here's what each symbol means:

### Section Markers

| Symbol | Section | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `Ψ:CORE` | Core Philosophy | Foundational principles that guide all behavior |
| `→:AUTONOMY` | Autonomy Rules | When to act, pause, or ask |
| `≠:ANTI` | Anti-Patterns | Behaviors to explicitly avoid |
| `Γ:SESSION` | Session Protocol | How to start, work through, and end sessions |
| `Σ:METHODOLOGY` | Auto-Methodology | Task detection → bank loading |
| `Φ:ROUTING` | Model Routing | Which AI model for which task |
| `Ω:KEYWORDS` | Magic Keywords | Shortcut modes for power users |
| `Ξ:GIT` | Git Discipline | Commit format, push protocol |
| `Δ:QUALITY` | Quality Gates | Pre-commit validation requirements |
| `∇:EVOLUTION` | Self-Evolution | How the system learns and updates itself |

### Inline Rules

Rules use a compact notation:

```
●rule_name|condition→action
```

Examples:
- `●fail_fast|exit_early|clear_errors|no_silent_failures` — Always exit early with clear errors
- `●atomic_commits|one_logical_change=one_commit` — Each commit is one logical unit
- `●pattern_repeats(2+)|→encode_to_rules` — When a pattern repeats, encode it as a rule

### Why This Syntax?

1. **Token efficiency** — ~800 tokens vs ~2000+ for verbose markdown. Less context consumed = more room for your code.
2. **Scannable** — Symbols create visual landmarks. Find sections instantly.
3. **Precise** — No ambiguity. Each rule is a clear directive.
4. **Evolvable** — Easy to add/remove rules without restructuring.

## Features

### Automatic Methodology

KERNEL detects what you're doing and applies the right approach:

| You're doing... | KERNEL automatically... | Bank |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------|
| Implementing a feature | Researches, plans, defines interfaces | PLANNING |
| Fixing a bug | Reproduces, isolates, finds root cause | DEBUGGING |
| Choosing an approach | Searches packages, finds 3+ sources | RESEARCH |
| Completing work | Reviews correctness, conventions, edge cases | REVIEW |
| Exploring new codebase | Maps structure, detects tooling, extracts patterns | DISCOVERY |
| Refactoring | Understands deeply, identifies specifics, prioritizes | ITERATION |
| Planning complex work | Challenges assumptions, finds risks | TEARITAPART |

Banks are loaded automatically. You don't invoke them.

### 5-Tier Model Routing

KERNEL routes work to the right model for cost and quality:

| Tier | Model | Best For | Cost |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| 1 | Ollama | Drafts, brainstorming, variations | Free (local) |
| 2 | Gemini | Web search, bulk file reads (50+), research | Free tier (2M context) |
| 3 | Sonnet | Implementation, synthesis, file writes | $3/1M input |
| 4 | Opus | Planning, design, orchestration, review | $15/1M input |
| 5 | Haiku | Test execution, lint, type checking | $0.25/1M input |

**The orchestrator (you) always runs on Opus.** Subagents are routed by task complexity.

### Magic Keywords

Type these anywhere to activate special modes:

| Keyword | Mode | What Happens |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `ulw` or `fast` | Ultrawork | Spawns 3-5 parallel agents for maximum throughput |
| `ralph` | Persistence | Loops until the task is verified complete — no stopping early |
| `eco` | Ecomode | Routes everything to the cheapest capable model |

### Hooks System

KERNEL includes prompt-based hooks that fire automatically:

**SessionStart** — When you open Claude Code, KERNEL detects your project type (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.), notes existing tests and build configs, and prepares to spawn validation agents.

**PostToolUse (Edit|Write)** — After any code modification, KERNEL considers spawning test-runner or type-checker in the background. No announcement — it just validates.

### Autonomy Rules

KERNEL knows when to act and when to ask:

| Action | Examples |
|--------|---------|
| **ACT** (just do it) | Read files, explore code, run allowed tools, reversible operations |
| **PAUSE** (be careful) | Destructive operations, irreversible changes, security-sensitive actions |
| **ASK** (get approval) | Multi-step plans, design decisions, ambiguous intent, uncertainty |

### Memory-First Protocol

Before every task, KERNEL checks existing knowledge:

```
_memory/               → Architecture, conventions, dependencies, hotspots, bugs, decisions
kernel/project-notes/  → Past bug solutions, ADRs, infrastructure knowledge, work logs
_meta/                 → Session context, learnings, active work state
```

**Why?** Memory check takes 10 seconds. Re-discovery takes 10+ minutes. KERNEL breaks the rediscovery loop.

### Quality Gates

Before any commit, KERNEL validates:

1. Tests pass
2. Types check
3. Lint clean
4. Security scan

**If any gate fails, the commit is blocked.** Quality is non-negotiable.

### Self-Evolution

KERNEL updates itself:

- Pattern repeats 2+ times → encoded as a rule
- Mistake repeats → prevention rule added
- Discovery made → logged to `_meta/_learnings.md` + config updated
- Stale rule found → deleted (deletion is evolution too)

### Frontend Design Philosophy

KERNEL enforces intentional design:

- **System fonts first** — Never Inter or Geist (AI aesthetic signatures)
- **No emoji in UI** — Professional, not playful
- **Sophistication through restraint** — Every element earns its place
- **One signature element** — Customize until unrecognizable
- **Anti-pattern enforcement** — Rejects AI slop (purple gradients, shadcn defaults, three-column grids)

Use `/design` to activate full design mode with audit, build, review, and token generation.

## Session Tracking

KERNEL maintains context across sessions:

```
_meta/
├── _session.md           # Session context (blockers, decisions, infrastructure)
├── _learnings.md         # Evolution log (append-only, dated entries)
├── context/
│   └── active.md         # Current work state
└── benchmark/
    ├── metrics.jsonl      # Quantitative performance data
    ├── journal.md         # Qualitative reflections
    └── summary.md         # Weekly rollup
```

### Session Protocol

```
START → Read _meta/_session.md, active.md, kernel/state.md, git status
DURING → Update active.md, log learnings, spawn agents proactively
END → @metadata-sync + @git-sync (both run in parallel, automatic)
```

## Philosophy

### Correctness Over Speed

KERNEL prioritizes working code on the first attempt. Mental simulation catches 80% of bugs before execution. Think before typing.

### Every Line Is Liability

Config over code. Native over custom. Existing over new. Delete what doesn't earn its place. The best code is code you don't write.

### Investigate Before Implement

Never assume. Find existing patterns first. Copy what works. Adapt minimally. Fighting the framework causes pain.

### Tailored, Not Templated

Every artifact is created because your project needs it:

```
Good: "Created test-runner because project has pytest"
Bad:  "Created test-runner because the template includes it"
```
