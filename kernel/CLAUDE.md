# Project Intelligence

## Philosophy

**CORRECTNESS > SPEED**
One working implementation beats three debug cycles.
Think before typing. Simulate before running.

**INVESTIGATE BEFORE IMPLEMENT**
Never assume. Search for existing patterns first.
Copy what works. Adapt minimally.

**DETECT, THEN ACT**
Don't assume tooling exists. Find it.
Don't assume conventions. Discover them.

**PROTECT STATE**
Backup before mutation.
Confirm before deletion.
Make time explicit (UTC + timezone).

## KERNEL

This project uses KERNEL for development intelligence.

**On-demand methodology:**
- `/discover` — Map codebase, populate state
- `/plan` — Get-it-right-first-time planning
- `/debug` — Systematic diagnosis
- `/review` — Correctness validation

**Living knowledge:**
- `kernel/state.md` — Current project reality (read first when uncertain)
- `kernel/banks/` — Methodology references (load via modes)
- `.claude/rules/` — Project patterns (evolves over time)

---

## Defaults

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Prefer existing patterns over new inventions
- Prefer small verified steps over large speculative leaps

**When uncertain:** Read `kernel/state.md`, then ask.
