# Project Intelligence

## Philosophy

**CORRECTNESS > SPEED**
One working implementation beats three debug cycles.
Think before typing. Simulate before running.

**INVESTIGATE BEFORE IMPLEMENT**
Never assume. Search for existing patterns first.
Copy what works. Adapt minimally.

**DETECT, THEN ACT**
Don't assume tooling exists. Find it.
Don't assume conventions. Discover them.

**PROTECT STATE**
Backup before mutation.
Confirm before deletion.
Make time explicit (UTC + timezone).

**NEVER WORK ON MAIN**
All work happens on isolated worktrees.
Create worktree first, then code. Commit often.
Git history IS the changelog. Ship via PR.

## Git Workflow: Worktree-Based Development

**Before starting work:**
1. Check current state: `git branch --show-current && git worktree list`
2. If on main → create worktree:
   ```bash
   PROJECT=$(basename $(pwd))
   git worktree add -b <type>/<description> ../${PROJECT}-<type>-<description>
   open -a Terminal ../${PROJECT}-<type>-<description>
   ```
3. Branch types: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `chore/`

**During work:**
- Work happens in the worktree directory
- Commit after completing logical units
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

**When done:**
- Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
- Create PR: `gh pr create`
- Cleanup: `git worktree remove <path> && git branch -d <branch>`

## KERNEL

This project uses KERNEL for development intelligence.

**On-demand methodology:**
- `/discover` — Map codebase, populate state
- `/plan` — Get-it-right-first-time planning
- `/debug` — Systematic diagnosis
- `/review` — Correctness validation
- `/branch` — Create worktree for isolated work
- `/ship` — Push and create PR
- `/parallelize` — Multiple worktrees for parallel streams

**Living knowledge:**
- `kernel/state.md` — Current project reality (read first when uncertain)
- `kernel/banks/` — Methodology references (load via modes)
- `.claude/rules/` — Project patterns (evolves over time)

---

## Defaults

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Prefer existing patterns over new inventions
- Prefer small verified steps over large speculative leaps

**When uncertain:** Read `kernel/state.md`, then ask.

## Configuration Layers

This project uses a layered configuration:

1. **Project-level** (this file + `kernel/`) — Highest priority
2. **User-level** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) — Universal principles
3. **Plugin defaults** — Lowest priority

Universal philosophy lives at user-level. Project-specific rules live here.
