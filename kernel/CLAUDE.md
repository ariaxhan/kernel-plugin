# Project Intelligence

## Philosophy

**CORRECTNESS > SPEED**
One working implementation beats three debug cycles.
Think before typing. Simulate before running.

**INVESTIGATE BEFORE IMPLEMENT**
Never assume. Search for existing patterns first.
Copy what works. Adapt minimally.

**DETECT, THEN ACT**
Don't assume tooling exists. Find it.
Don't assume conventions. Discover them.

**PROTECT STATE**
Backup before mutation.
Confirm before deletion.
Make time explicit (UTC + timezone).

**NEVER WORK ON MAIN**
All work happens on intention-focused branches.
Branch first, then code. Commit often.
Git history IS the changelog. Ship via PR.

## Git Workflow

**Before starting work:**
1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If on main → create branch: `git checkout -b <type>/<description>`
3. Branch types: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `chore/`

**During work:**
- Commit after completing logical units
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

**When done:**
- Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
- Create PR: `gh pr create`
- Never merge to main locally

## KERNEL

This project uses KERNEL for development intelligence.

**On-demand methodology:**
- `/discover` — Map codebase, populate state
- `/plan` — Get-it-right-first-time planning
- `/debug` — Systematic diagnosis
- `/review` — Correctness validation

**Living knowledge:**
- `kernel/state.md` — Current project reality (read first when uncertain)
- `kernel/banks/` — Methodology references (load via modes)
- `.claude/rules/` — Project patterns (evolves over time)

---

## Defaults

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Prefer existing patterns over new inventions
- Prefer small verified steps over large speculative leaps

**When uncertain:** Read `kernel/state.md`, then ask.
