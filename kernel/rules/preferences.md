# Preferences

**Negotiable defaults: formatting, presentation, tool choices**

<!--
TO EVOLVE: Add preferences as they're confirmed, not guessed.
Examples:
- Date format: Jan 15, 2026 (not 2026-01-15)
- Indentation: 2 spaces (not tabs)
- Quote style: single quotes (not double)
- Line length: 100 chars
- Import order: stdlib, third-party, local

Add only when user confirms preference. Remove if contradicted.
Max 20 bullets. If full, consolidate or remove least relevant.

⚠️ **TEMPLATE NOTICE**
This file starts empty and grows from confirmed user preferences.
Never guess. Always confirm before adding.
Preferences are negotiable - they can change over time.
