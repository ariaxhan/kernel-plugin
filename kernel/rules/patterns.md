# Patterns

**Discovered codebase patterns: naming, error handling, logging, config**

<!--
TO EVOLVE: Add patterns as they're observed in the codebase, not assumed.
Examples:
- Functions: camelCase for public, _underscorePrefix for private
- Errors: Custom exception classes inherit from BaseError
- Logging: Use logger.info() for normal, logger.error() for failures
- Config: Environment variables loaded via python-dotenv, prefix APP_
- File naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes

Add when pattern observed 2+ times and confirmed via pattern-capture hook.
Max 20 bullets. If full, move stable patterns to kernel/state.md or consolidate.

⚠️ **TEMPLATE NOTICE**
This file starts empty and grows from observed codebase patterns.
Patterns emerge from reconnaissance and repeated observations.
Use pattern-capture hook to propose additions (never auto-add).
