# Architecture Decisions

**Recorded choices: Why X over Y, context, trade-offs**

<!--
TO EVOLVE: Add decisions as they're made during development.
Format:
## Decision: [Title]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Context: [Why did this question come up?]
- Considered: [Options A, B, C]
- Chose: [Option X]
- Rationale: [Why X over others]
- Trade-offs: [What we gave up, what we gained]

Examples:
## Decision: Use SQLite for local storage
- Date: 2026-01-15
- Context: Need persistent storage for user data
- Considered: PostgreSQL, SQLite, JSON files
- Chose: SQLite
- Rationale: Lightweight, no server, perfect for single-user desktop app
- Trade-offs: Limited concurrency, but we're single-user anyway
