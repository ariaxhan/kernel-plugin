# Plan Mode

Entering PLANNING mode.

1. Read `kernel/banks/PLANNING-BANK.md` for methodology
2. Read `kernel/state.md` for current context
3. Apply planning: understand goal, extract assumptions, investigate patterns, define interfaces, mental simulation
4. Update `kernel/state.md` with any new discoveries

Planning mode prioritizes correctness over speed. One working implementation beats three debug cycles.
