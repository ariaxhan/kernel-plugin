# Discover Mode

Entering DISCOVERY mode.

1. Read `kernel/banks/DISCOVERY-BANK.md` for methodology
2. Read `kernel/state.md` for current context
3. Apply reconnaissance: inventory files, detect tooling, extract conventions, identify risks
4. Update `kernel/state.md` with all discoveries

Discovery mode focuses on populating the world model with reality, not assumptions.
