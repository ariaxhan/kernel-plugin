# Debug Mode

Entering DEBUGGING mode.

1. Read `kernel/banks/DEBUGGING-BANK.md` for methodology
2. Read `kernel/state.md` for current context
3. Apply systematic debugging: reproduce, isolate, instrument, understand root cause, fix, verify
4. Update `kernel/state.md` with any new patterns discovered

Debugging mode focuses on root causes, not symptoms. Systematic debugging beats random changes.
