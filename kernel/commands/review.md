# Review Mode

Entering REVIEW mode.

1. Read `kernel/banks/REVIEW-BANK.md` for methodology
2. Read `kernel/state.md` for current context
3. Apply review checklist: correctness, convention adherence, invariant checks, validation matrix
4. Update `kernel/state.md` if review reveals gaps in conventions or validation

Review mode validates against spec, conventions (state.md), and invariants (.claude/rules/invariants.md).
