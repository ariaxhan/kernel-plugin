# Branch Command

Create a focused branch before starting work.

## Steps

1. **Check current state**
   ```bash
   git status --short
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **If already on a feature branch**
   - Ask: continue on this branch or create new?
   - If continue: exit early

3. **Get branch intention**
   Ask user for:
   - Type: feat | fix | docs | refactor | test | chore
   - Description: 2-4 words, kebab-case

4. **Create branch**
   - Uncommitted changes will automatically move to new branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <type>/<description>
   ```

5. **Open new terminal**
   - Open a fresh terminal in the project directory
   - This isolates the new branch work environment

6. **Push branch** (only if no uncommitted changes)
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <type>/<description>
   ```
   - If there are uncommitted changes, inform user they can push after first commit

7. **Confirm**
   Report: "Ready to work on `<branch>` in new terminal. Uncommitted changes moved to this branch."
