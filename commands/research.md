# Research Mode

Entering RESEARCH mode.

1. Read `kernel/banks/RESEARCH-BANK.md` for methodology
2. Read `kernel/state.md` for current context
3. Apply research process: plan searches, find existing solutions, document pitfalls
4. Create `.claude/research/{feature-name}-research.md` with findings
5. Update `kernel/state.md` with any patterns discovered

Research finds the simplest, most reliable solution. The best code is code you don't write.

**Core principle:** Find existing packages before writing custom code. Popular = battle-tested.
