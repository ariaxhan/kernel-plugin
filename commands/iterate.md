# Iterate Mode

Entering ITERATION mode.

1. Read `kernel/banks/ITERATION-BANK.md` for methodology
2. Read `kernel/state.md` for current context
3. Apply iteration process: understand deeply, identify improvements, prioritize by UX impact
4. Create `.claude/iterations/{target-name}/` workspace with understanding, improvements, history
5. Implement high-priority improvements one at a time
6. Update `kernel/state.md` with any patterns discovered

Iteration makes existing code better, simpler, faster, more bulletproof.

**Core principle:** Code reduction is king. Less code = fewer bugs = easier maintenance.
